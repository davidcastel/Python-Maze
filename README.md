# Python-Maze
----------
You can now play the Blind maze. 

This is my final Computer Science Project that I worked on for 10 weeks. 

You will run through the maze without seeing the walls using the common (A|W|S|D) movement system.

You can see where you are going my typing "map" in the terminal to see where a new map will be printed where the current location will be shown and see the path until the end. 

The finish line is "=>" where you will be able to win the game.
