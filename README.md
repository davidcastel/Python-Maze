# Python-Maze :snake:
You can now play the Blind maze. 

### About :blue_book: :
This is my final project for my Computer Science (CS 171) class. The objective was to use what I learned in the class and be able to create a game. I decided to create a maze game in python on the terminal. The purpose of the game is to have the player go through the maze with seeing the walls and eventually make it to the end of the maze. 

:warning: Make sure you have a version of python installed and running on your local machine. :warning:
